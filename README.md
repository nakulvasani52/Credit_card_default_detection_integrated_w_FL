# Credit_card_default_detection_integrated_w_FL

This project presents a novel approach for predicting credit card defaulters by leveraging data from Taiwan spanning the period between July 2005 and November 2005. The framework combines Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN) with Federated Learning (FL) to enhance accuracy and ensure higher security in the prediction process.

The dataset comprises historical credit card usage information, including various financial attributes, demographic factors, and payment behavior of customers during the specified time frame. To build a predictive model, a FFNN architecture is utilized, which is well-suited for handling complex patterns in financial data and forecasting future trends.

Incorporating Federated Learning into the framework allows us to address privacy and security concerns effectively. By keeping the data decentralized on individual devices, FL ensures that sensitive credit card defaulter data remains private and is not exposed to a centralized server. Only model parameters (weights) are shared and aggregated, protecting the privacy of individual users.

Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the integration of FL significantly enhances the accuracy of credit card defaulter prediction compared to traditional centralized approaches. The FFNN-FL framework exhibits improved robustness and generalization capabilities, enabling more accurate identification of potential credit card defaulters.

This project contributes to the field of credit risk analysis and demonstrates the potential of federated learning in addressing data privacy and security concerns in predictive modeling. The combination of FFNN and FL holds promise for financial institutions and credit card companies seeking accurate and secure prediction of future defaulters, leading to more effective risk management strategies.
